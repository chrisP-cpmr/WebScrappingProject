# WebScrappingProject
As part of my studies, we had to create a web scapping program.

I have decided to scrape singles charts data from Hitparade.ch since 1990 for every week.

The website requires a delay of 10 seconds between every call of the website.

The result is saved to a .csv file.

A user of the program only needs to provide the year since when the data needs to be retrieved.
From the beginning of the year till the last Sunday form todays date, the programm will retrieve all singles charts for every week.

Once the data has been extracted, it has to be run through the program for cleaning. Afterwards the structure is suitable for further processing.
